#### **Interoperability from semantic point of view**

<p class="text-justify"><i>One of the most obvious statements is: interoperability requires understanding between parties.Establishing such understanding between humans can be, at least to some extent, achievable. The situation becomes more complex when non-human artifacts enter the mix. As an example, let us consider the Internet of Things (IoT). Here, lack of interoperability between platforms/systems/applications(artifacts) has been recognized as one of key issues that prevents faster development of IoT ecosystems. While interoperability can be considered on many levels across the software stack, I will focus on semantic interoperability.</i></p>
<p class="text-justify"><i>In the presentation I will discuss how semantic technologies can be used to facilitate interoperability between IoT artifacts (and beyond). Research presented in the talk is supported by EU-H2020- ICT grant INTER-IoT 687283.</i></p>

<p class="text-justify"><i>Digital collaboration has come a long way, but are we ready to achieve digital collaboration to the degree that analysts and experts are expecting? What are the prerequisites to industrial cross eco-system collaboration? What are pitfall, which dead ends have we already encountered?</i></p>
                           
<p class="text-justify"><i>A journey of industrial inter-company digitization and how two leading pioneers of communication are jointly embracing semantic standards to once again lead us to new frontiers they themselves call “the cognitive supply network”.</i></p>
